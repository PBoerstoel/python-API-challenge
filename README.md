# python-API-challenge

This was kinda fun to work on! Working with the APIs went pretty smooth, but there were some finnicky moments, like taking a while to realize "hotel" by itself wasn't an accepted category. Overall though, it went well.

Also creating a function for the regressions was a great idea, thanks for the suggestion. It made what would have been a bunch of copying and pasting into just one line of code for each regression.
